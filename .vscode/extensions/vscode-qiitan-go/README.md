# vscode-qiitan-go

This extension provides syntax highlighting for the Qiitan scripting language.

## Usage

As [described in the VSCode documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#your-extension-folder), non-published extensions (non-market-place-extensions) need to be copied manually.

- Copy the `vscode-qiitan-go` directory in VSCode's extension directory.
    ```shellsession
    $ cp -r /path/to/repo/.vscode/extensions/vscode-qiitan-go/ ~/.vscode/extensions/vscode-qiitan-go/
    ```
- Re-boot VSCode and enjoy your syntax highlighting!

## Bugs

If you find any bugs / wrong highlighting, just fill an issue or a pull request if you already fixed it.

## Sincere Thanks

This extension is verymuch based on graphman65's Tengo syntax highlighting extension.
